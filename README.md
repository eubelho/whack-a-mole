# what-a-mole
Project 1 Demo - HTML/JS/CSS

# Description
This a game made from HTML, JS, & CSS that is similar to whack-a-mole.

# Notes

`git remote -v` returns your git "remotes"
- Remotes are URLS that point to a place on the web
- origin is your remote on github (default remote)

Centering in CSS
Many ways to do it, but having a margin of auto on the left and right will center any element that has a fixed width:

```css
    margin: 0 auto;
    width: 300px;
```

## Making a commit (basic workflow);
1. Make changes (`git status` to make changes)
2. `git add -A` (or `git add .`)
    - This "stages" all change for commit
3. `git commit -m` "initial page load with grid and leaderboard"
    - this makes the literal commit
4. `git push origin main`
    -
